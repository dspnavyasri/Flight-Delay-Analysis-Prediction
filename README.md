# Flight Delay Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict flight delays using U.S. flight data from 2009â€“2018. The dataset contains extensive information on flights such as airline, flight date, departure delay, arrival delay, etc.

## Data Source
- Data has been collected from Kaggle.
- Dataset link: [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data 2009-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018).
- The dataset contains CSV files for each year, totaling approximately 7GB with around 6 million rows per year.

## Tools Used
- Apache Spark for big data processing.
- Python for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- Libraries used include PySpark, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Data Processing
- Loaded the CSV files into Spark RDD.
- Converted RDD to DataFrame and performed data type casting.
- Registered DataFrame as a temporary view for querying.

## Analysis
- Conducted analysis on delay causes using Spark SQL.
- Visualized delay causes as percentages of total delay time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Machine Learning
- Utilized Spark MLlib for machine learning tasks.
- Preprocessed data by encoding categorical columns and assembling features.
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict departure delay.
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

## Usage
- Ensure you have Apache Spark installed.
- Clone the repository and download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
- Update the file paths accordingly in the code.
- Run the code files in a Spark environment.

## Results
- Identified major delay causes such as carrier delay, NAS delay, etc.
- Developed a predictive model with reasonable performance for departure delay.

## Future Work
- Explore more advanced machine learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features or external data sources for improved analysis and prediction.
- Optimize the code for better performance, especially for handling large datasets.
